## LunarVim

## FZF

[FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is a command-line fuzzy finder that allows for fast and efficient searching in files, directories, and more.

### Basic Usage

**Interactive Fuzzy Finder:**

FZF is primarily used to interactively search and select items from a list. For example, you can search through files, command history, and more.

- **Search through command history:**
  Pressing `Ctrl + R` allows you to search through your command history interactively. As you type, FZF filters the history based on your input, making it easy to find and execute previous commands.

- **Search through files (fzf-tmux integration):**
  `Ctrl + T` launches FZF in file search mode. This lets you search for files and directories interactively from the current directory. If you are using tmux, FZF integrates seamlessly with it.
